#Handwritten Digit Recognition App using Keras and Tkinter
This code demonstrates a simple application for recognizing handwritten digits using a pre-trained Keras model. The user can draw a digit on a canvas using the mouse, and the application will predict the digit based on the drawn image.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Keras
Tkinter
win32gui
PIL

#Usage
Clone the repository or download the script directly.
Make sure you have the pre-trained model file (mnist.h5) available in the same directory as the script.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
Copy code
pip install keras tensorflow pillow
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python digit_recognition_app.py
A new window will open, displaying a canvas for drawing.
Use the mouse to draw a digit on the canvas.
Click the "Recognize" button to predict the drawn digit.
The predicted digit and the prediction accuracy will be displayed.
Click the "Clear" button to clear the canvas and draw a new digit.
Close the window to exit the application.

#How It Works
The script loads the pre-trained Keras model using load_model.
The predict_digit function takes the drawn image as input, preprocesses it, and uses the model to predict the digit.
The Tkinter application is created, which includes a canvas for drawing, a label to display the prediction, and buttons for recognizing and clearing the canvas.
When the user draws on the canvas, the draw_lines function is called, which creates an oval shape at the mouse coordinates to represent the drawn digit.
Clicking the "Recognize" button grabs the canvas's image using ImageGrab.grab, sends it to the predict_digit function, and updates the label with the predicted digit and accuracy.
Clicking the "Clear" button deletes all the drawn shapes from the canvas.
Closing the window terminates the application.
